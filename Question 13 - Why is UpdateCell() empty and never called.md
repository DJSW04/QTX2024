Description of problem: Currently, the UpdateCell() method contains 'pass' and is not called anywhere in the program. This will almost certainly be a question, otherwise why would they include it? This may relate to the bombing idea where a Blocked Cell is bombed, and the UpdateCell() is then called to modify this Blocked Cell into a normal cell. Please suggest other ideas of what this method could be used for.
